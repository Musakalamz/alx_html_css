# CSS Basics – ALX Front-End Web Development (Week 5)

This repository contains my **Week 5 Front-End Web Development project** for the ALX program.  
The focus of this project is to learn and practice **CSS fundamentals**, including styling rules, selectors, classes, specificity, flexbox layout, and responsive design — all using only **HTML and CSS** (no external libraries or frameworks).

---

## 📚 Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, I am able to explain (without Google):

- What CSS is and how it works
- How to add style to an HTML element
- What a CSS selector is
- The difference between classes, IDs, and element selectors
- How CSS specificity values are computed
- What box properties in CSS are
- How the browser loads and applies CSS rules to a webpage

## 🛠 Requirements

- All files must end with a new line
- A `README.md` file at the root of the project is mandatory
- No external libraries or frameworks (e.g., Bootstrap, React, Vue)
- Code must be **W3C compliant** and validate with [W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)

## ✅ Tasks Overview

### 0. Early Styling

- Add `base.css` (provided by ALX) and an empty `styles.css`
- Link both stylesheets in the `<head>` of `index.html` and `tweets.html`

### 1. Positioning with Flexbox

- Use `display: flex` to structure `<body>` and `<main>`
- `<body>`: column layout (`flex-direction: column`)
- `<main>`: row layout (`flex-direction: row`)
- `<article>` takes **2/3 width**, `<aside>` takes **1/3 width**
- Add `overflow-y: auto` for scrollable sections

### 2. Responsive Web Design

- Add `class="works_on_smartphone"` to `<body>` in `index.html`
- Configure the viewport with `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">`

### 3. Additional Styling

- Customize colors, borders, and typography in `styles.css`
- Add a simple "logo" (unicode character) in the header
- Enhance the `<article>` content with your own creativity
